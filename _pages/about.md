I am a graduate student. I major in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.umass.edu/), at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am guided by [Prof. Tongping Liu](https://people.umass.edu/tongping/index.html) and [Prof. Hui Guan](https://guanh01.github.io/).

My research field includes Machine Learning Supporting Systems, aiming to improve the speed and reliability of Machine Learning. My current research focuses on finding the composability in Transformer neural networks pruning in the aspects of algorithm and system to speed up Transformer pruning, and developing a pruning framework.

I also have a wide range of interest in multiple fields including Binary Security, Operating System, and Demoscene (Computer Graphics). I am a passionate and efficient learner of all computer related subjects.

See [**"CV"** Tab](https://yuplin2333.github.io/cv/) above for my detailed personal information.
