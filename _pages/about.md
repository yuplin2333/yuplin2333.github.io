I am a master graduate student. I major in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.umass.edu/), at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am working with [Prof. Tongping Liu](https://people.umass.edu/tongping/index.html) and [Prof. Hui Guan](https://guanh01.github.io/).

My research field includes Machine Learning Supporting Systems, aiming to improve the speed and reliability of Machine Learning. My current research project focuses on finding the composability in Transformer neural networks pruning in the aspects of algorithm and system to speed up Transformer pruning, and developing a pruning framework.

Besides that, I also have a wide range of interest in multiple fields including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Information Security, Operating and Programming System, and Computer Graphics. Most importantly, I am a passionate and efficient learner of all computer related subjects.
