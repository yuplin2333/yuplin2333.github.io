I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [the DSE Lab](https://dse.cse.msu.edu/) of Michigan State University, advised by [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/).

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to email me at linyupin \[#at#\] msu \[#dot#\] edu.

## Research Area

**Security in Large Language Models (LLMs)**, including the discovery of new security vulnerabilities, the design and evaluation of LLM-focused attacks, and the development of robust defensive solutions.

**Interpretability and Explainability of LLMs**, including the investigation of internal mechanisms and decision-making processes (such as retrieval and circuits), and enhancing the transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability of these systems.

**Design and Optimization of LLM-based Agents**, including the investigation of agent architectures and core capabilities (such as memory management and long-context processing), the development of novel techniques to enhance agent performance, and the creation of practical tools to improve system efficiency and scalability.
