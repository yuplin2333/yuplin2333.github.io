I'm a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [the DSE Lab](https://dse.cse.msu.edu/) of Michigan State University, advised by [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/).

My research field includes Trustworthy AI, seeking to develop artificial intelligence systems that are safe, reliable, transparent, explainable, accountable, and free from biases. I also maintain a broad interest in various fields, including model pruning and NLP.
