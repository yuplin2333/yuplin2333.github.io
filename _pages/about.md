I am a graduate student. I major in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.umass.edu/), at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am guided by [Prof. Tongping Liu](https://people.umass.edu/tongping/index.html) and [Prof. Hui Guan](https://guanh01.github.io/).

My research field includes Machine Learning Supporting Systems, aiming to improve the speed and reliability of Machine Learning. My current research focuses on finding the composability in Transformer neural networks pruning in the aspects of algorithm and system.

See **"CV"** Tab above for my detailed personal information.
